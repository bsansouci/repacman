# Contributing

Contributions are welcomed!

Check out the [Issues](https://github.com/reasonml-community/repacman/issues) to see who is working on what. In case something is not taken and you feel like working on that, feel free to assign the issue to yourself and give it a try!

We recommend opening an issue first before working on something, it makes it more transparent what's going on.
